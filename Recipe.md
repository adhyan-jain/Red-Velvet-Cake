Recipe

1.  Pre-heat the oven to 180*C and line a 9" round cake pan with parchment paper.
2.  In a large bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda together. I recommend you sift all the dry ingredients once.
3.  In a separate bowl, combine sugar and oil. Beat well.
4.  Add yogurt, vanilla, red color and lemon juice and mix until everything is well combined.
5.  Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients in three batches, alternating with buttermilk.
6.  Be careful to not over mix. Beat only until everything is well combined and there are no large flour pockets.
7.  Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Your eggless red velvet cake is ready!
